# PacManProject
Factory for making pacmen.
Given a starter.html code the idea is to position a new pacman image once we click on "make one". To be able to bounce the new pacman image we need to track its dimensions relative to the game screen (div). It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
Add new pacmen and start game!
